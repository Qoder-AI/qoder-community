## Use Cases

- Self-check before feature completion
- Final check before code submission
- Quality verification before release
- Deliverable completeness confirmation
- Reduce rework and omissions

## Core Capabilities

- **Checklists**: Systematic verification items
- **Automated Checks**: Items that can be auto-verified
- **Manual Verification**: Items requiring human confirmation
- **Documentation Completeness**: Check if related docs are updated

## Example

```
I've finished refactoring the order module, please help with pre-completion verification:
1. Feature completeness check
2. Test coverage check
3. Code quality check
4. Documentation update check
5. Performance impact assessment
```

## Notes

- Customize checklist based on project type
- Don't skip any check items
- Record verification results
- Fix issues found promptly
