## Use Cases

- Standardize Git commit messages
- Auto-create Pull Requests
- Code review process management
- Branch management strategy implementation
- Release process automation

## Core Capabilities

- **Conventional Commits**: Standards-compliant commit messages
- **PR Templates**: Standardized PR descriptions
- **Review Checklists**: Ensure code quality
- **Branch Naming**: Consistent branch naming conventions

## Example

```
I've completed user auth feature development, please help:
1. Generate Conventional Commits compliant commit message
2. Create PR with change description and test steps
3. List key points for review
```

## Notes

- Each commit does one thing
- Keep PRs reasonably sized
- Clearly describe why changes were made
- Include test verification steps
